Initializer Lists:
==================

1. Why should you using initializer list as opposed to normal initialization.
answer:
a) const data members: Must be initialized using initializer list
b) reference data members: int &a. Must be initialized using initializer list
c) initializing base class data members
if a Class A doesnt have a default constructor and it is a data member for class B, then class A must be initialized using initializer list in class B's constructor
class A
{
    A(int x){

    }
}

class B : A
{
  A a;
  B(int x): a(x){

  }

}
d) when constructor's parameter name is same as data member
e) Performance reasons
